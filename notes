7.1 Packages and Crates

Crate
- Crate is smallest amount of code that Rust compiler considers at a time
- Library like python libraries
- Types of crates
  - Binary -> has main and cmpile to executable
  - Library -> doesn't has main and don't compile to executable
    - They define functionality
- Crate root -> starting file
- src/lib.rs -> library crate -> cargo new <name> --lib
- src/main.rs -> binary crates

Package
- Contain atmost on library crate and many binary crates

7.2 Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy
- Start from the crate root
- Declaring modules
- Declaring submodules  

7.3 Paths for referring to an item in the Module Tree
- Absolute path -> full path
  - for code from external crate the path starts with crate name
  - for code from current crate the path starts with crate
- Relative path -> starts from current module and uses
  - Self
  - Super
  - An identifier in current module
- Both are separated by ::
